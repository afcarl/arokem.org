Nitime: time-series analysis for neuroscience
--------------------------------------------

`Nitime <http://nipy.org/nitime>`_ is a library for time-series analysis of
data from neuroscience experiments. It contains implementations a high-level
representation of time and of time-series data, as well as algorithms for
time-series analysis (spectral analysis, coherence estimation, event-related
analysis, multi-variate auto-regressive model fitting, and more), convenience
classes for analysis and visualization. This software library is being
developed in close collaboration with `Fernando Perez <http://fperez.org>`_ (to
whom I also owe the machinery used to create `this website
<http://fperez.org/code/index.html#how-this-site-is-built>`_) and
`several others <https://github.com/nipy/nitime/graphs/contributors>`_. The
figure below is an example of analysis of fmri data conducted using nitime.
