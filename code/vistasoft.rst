`Vistasoft <https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft>`_ is the code repository of
the `Vistalab`__ at Stanford university, implemented mostly in Matlab. It
contains functions for the analysis of BOLD fMRI and diffusion MRI data,
including state-of-the-art methods for stimulus presentation, analysis and
modeling of MRI data from visual neuroscience experiments and powerful tools
for the visualization of these data and the models derived from them. Below is
