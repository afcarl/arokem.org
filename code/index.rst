 Software Development and Data Sharing
=======================================

As our tools to study the brain become more and more sophisticated, we are
faced with massive amounts of data. Increasingly, scientific research requires
writing software to deal with these growing amounts of data and in order to
apply more sophisticated methods of analysis. In order for scientific
results to be reproducible it is essential that we make data available to other
researchers and that we publish the computer code used to generate our
results.

Here are some of my attempts to do that. For more, take a look at my `github
portfolio`__

NIPY
====

`Nipy`__ is a community which fosters the collaborative writing of reproducible
research code for neuroimaging in the `Python`__ programming language. I have
made contributiong to many of the libraries within this framework, and I am currently
involved as a core developer in two libraries:

Data Sharing
============
   
Grasshopper data
----------------

I have made a couple of the data sets that I collected at the `ITB`__ available
on the `CRCNS`__ website. You can find the details `here
<http://crcns.org/data-sets/ia>`_.

Diffusion MRI data
------------------

Together with colleagues at Stanford, I have recently shared a high angular
resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data set, measured with multiple gradient
strengths, and test-retest. This data-set can be found `here`__.
