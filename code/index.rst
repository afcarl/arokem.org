 Software Development
======================

Scientific research requires writing computer code. In order for scientific
results to be reproducible it is essential that we publish the computer code
used to generate our results. In an effort to start doing that, I am trying to
develop research software that can be used by others. I started doing that as a
graduate student at Berkeley, working on the `nipy`__ project.  Here are
software project(s) I have been working on:

Nitime
------

`Nitime`__ is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience
experiments. It implements a high-level representation of time and of
time-series data, as well as implementation of algorithms for time-series
analysis (spectral analysis, coherence estimation, event-related analysis,
multi-variate auto-regressive model fitting, and more), implementation of
convenience classes for analysis and visualization. This software library is
being developed as part of the `nipy`__ project, with the guidance of 
`Fernando Perez`__ (to whom I also owe the machinery used to create `this
website <http://fperez.org/code/index.html#how-this-site-is-built>`_) and in
collaboration with several others,
