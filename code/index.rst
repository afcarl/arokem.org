 Software Development
======================

Scientific research is increasingly becoming more and more rooted in the
writing of software. I firmly believe that in order for scientific results to
be reproducible it is essential to publish the computer code written, together
with the results. I try to develop research software that can be used by
others. I started doing that as a graduate student at Berkeley, working on the
`nipy`__ project. I have learned a lot from working on these things with
`Fernando Perez`__ (to whom I also owe the machinery used to create this
`website <http://fperez.org/code/index.html#how-this-site-is-built>`_).

Nitime
------

`Nitime`__ is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience
experiments. It implements a high-level representation of time and of
time-series data, as well as implementation of algorithms for time-series
analysis (spectral analysis, coherence estimation, event-related analysis,
multi-variate auto-regressive model fitting, and more), implementation of
convenience classes for analysis and visualization.
