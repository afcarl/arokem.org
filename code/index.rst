 Software Development
======================

In the interest of conducting reproducible, I try to develop research software
that can be used by others. I started doing that as a graduate student at
Berkeley, working on the `nipy`__ project. I have learned a lot from working on
these things with `Fernando Perez`__ (to whom I also owe the machinery used to
create this `website
<http://fperez.org/code/index.html#how-this-site-is-built>`_).

Nitime
------

`Nitime`__ is a library for time-series analysis of data from neuroscience
experiments. It implements a high-level representation of time and of
time-series data, as well as implementation of algorithms for time-series
analysis (spectral analysis, coherence estimation, event-related analysis,
multi-variate auto-regressive model fitting, and more), implementation of
convenience classes for analysis and visualization.
