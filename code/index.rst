 Software Development and Data Sharing
=======================================

A significant part of my work as a scientist involves writing software for the analysis of data from neuroscience experiments. Over the years, I have been involved in the development of several software libraries.

For more code, take a look at my `github portfolio`__

NIPY
====

`Nipy`__ is a community which fosters the collaborative writing of reproducible
research code for neuroimaging in the `Python`__ programming language. I have
made contributiong to many of the libraries within this framework, and I am currently involved as a core developer in two libraries:

Data Sharing
============
   
Grasshopper data
----------------

I have made a couple of the data sets that I collected at the `ITB`__ available
on the `CRCNS`__ website. You can find the details `here
<http://crcns.org/data-sets/ia>`_.

Diffusion MRI data
------------------

Together with colleagues at Stanford, I shared a high angular
resolution diffusion MRI (HARDI) data set, measured with multiple gradient
strengths, and test-retest. This data-set can be found `here`__.
