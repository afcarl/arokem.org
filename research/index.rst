The goal of my research is to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying
the computations performed by the human visual system. My previous research
training has used tools for studying this topic on the physiological,
behavioral and quantitative level. My current goal is to combine these
approaches in order to understand basic questions in the organization of the
visual system in healthy and diseased states.

The goal of my current research project is to characterize the neural substrate
underlying differences between perception of the central and peripheral parts
of the visual field. Important visual functions, such as reading, require
central vision and clinical conditions, such as macular degeneration
selectively affect this part of the visual field, conferring significant
disability. I am focusing the investigation on the perception of boundaries
between different textures. These boundaries are used in order to parse images
into distinct regions and objects and perception of these boundaries differs
between central and peripheral vision. These differences are likely to result
from the manner in which information is processed in different parts of the
visual field and the way in which information is transmitted through the visual
system, via the anatomical connections between different regions of the visual
system.
